The barcode scanner interface has two operation modes. In both of them user
can scan:

#. Warehouse locations with barcode.
#. Product packaging with barcode.
#. Product with barcode.
#. Product Lots (The barcode is name field in this case).


Automatic operation mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the default mode, all screen controls are locked to avoid scan into
fields.

The user only has to scan barcode in physical warehouse locations with a
scanner hardward, the interface read the barcode and do operations in this
order:

#. Try search a product, if found, is assigned to product_id field and creates
   or update inventory line with 1.0 unit. (If product has tracking by lots
   the interface wait for a lot to be scanned).
#. Try search a product packaging, if found, the product_id related is set,
   product quantities are updated and create or update inventory line with
   product quantities defined in the product packaging.
#. Try search a lot (The product is mandatory in this case so you first scan a
   product and then scann a lot), this lot field is not erased until that
   product change, so for each product scann the interface add or update a
   inventory line with this lot.
#. Try to search a location, if found the field location is set and next scan
   action will be done with this warehouse location.

If barcode has not found, when message is displayed you can create this lot
scanning the product.

Manual entry mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change to "manual entry" to allow to select data without scanner
hardware, but hardward scanner still active on, so a use case would be when
user wants set quantities manually instead increment 1.0 unit peer scan action.

Scan logs
~~~~~~~~~

All scanned barcodes are saved into model.
Barcode scanning interface display 10 last records linked to model, the goal of
this log is show to user other reads with the same product and location done
by other users.
User can remove the last read scan.

Barcode interface for barcode actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use the barcode interface for actions:

#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Barcode Actions*.
#. Create a new barcode action and configure the barcode.

   :alt: Print barcodes

#. Select the barcode actions you want to use, a button (PRINT BARCODES) will appear that allows you to print the configured barcodes to PDF.

#. Start scanning barcodes from actions.
